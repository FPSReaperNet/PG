What it is and does:

System Information Collector: This script is designed to gather detailed information about a Windows system, including hardware specifications, network configurations, and user account details.
Data Collection: It collects data such as CPU details, RAM usage, disk information, network settings, and user account statuses.
Data Upload: The collected information is then uploaded to a specified Discord webhook **But just be sure that its not to my preset one "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1331140045272514654/wcvxngeUklMTVnBa1yWN4J7uNF5LjVnS9woCIkhYIElvT2fRj29cN_tYOPxb0iex7VYJ" i forgot to change it to WEBHOOK_URL_HERE I don't need to get this info** for further analysis or monitoring.
Features:

Administrator Privileges: The script requests administrator rights to access comprehensive system information, including browser data(I don't currently think its working though I will patch it before 1.3 prob).
Detailed System Information: It gathers extensive details about the system's hardware and software configurations(Like seriously).
Network and Security Data: The script collects network configurations, login histories, and user account information(Like finding a needle in a haystack).
Browser Data: It retrieves browser history and cookies, specifically for Chrome(Also currently believed to be broken coming before 1.3 hopefully).
Data Transmission: The collected data is sent to a Discord webhook as a text file for easy access and review.
Use:

Replace Webhook URL: Insert your Discord webhook URL in the designated section of the script.
Execution: Run the script on the target system.
Data Access: The collected information will be available in your specified Discord channel.
